    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Answer: A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. \n",
    "    An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. \n",
    "    Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.So a module in python is simply a way to organize the code,\n",
    "        and it contains either python classes or just functions. \n",
    "        If you need those classes or functions in your project, you just import them. "

    "Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",

    "Example: developer = employee('Male',20000), Here developer is an instance of class employee with attriubutes 'Male' and 20000.\n",
