    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Answer:  Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. It uses the concept of object and class. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects.It also Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program. Multiple instances of an object can be made."

    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Answer: Inheritance searches for an attribute in an upward tree of attributes. It first searches for the attribute in its instance and then looks in the class it is generated from, to all super classes listed in its class header."

    "1.Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "2.Seperate memory is allocated for each object where as there is no memory allocation for class.\n",
    "3.A Class is created once. Many objects are created using a class.\n",

    "Answer: __init__ is a reseved method in python classes. It serves the role of a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class."
